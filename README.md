# CS374_Prog2

 My program reads a CSV file containing movie data, processes the data into a linked list of movie structures,
 and allows the user to interact with the data through a menu.
 The user can:
 1. View movies released in a specific year.
 2. See the highest-rated movie for each year.
 3. Find movies available in a specific language.
 4. Exit the program.
